# FarkleCPP

**Course:** GAM 312 – Scripting in C++ for Games  
**Developer:** Scott Lee 
**Date Completed:** February 22, 2025  

## Description
FarkleCPP is a text-based dice game implemented in C++. Players take turns rolling dice, scoring points according to Farkle rules, and competing to reach the winning score first. This project demonstrates structured programming, algorithm design, and console-based game mechanics.

## Features
- Classic Farkle dice game rules  
- Turn-based gameplay for multiple players  
- Score tracking and win condition logic  
- Planned enhancement: special dice types (e.g., "Joker") that alter gameplay strategy  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Programming fundamentals in C++  
- Problem-solving and logical reasoning  
- Command prompt interaction and user input handling  
- Gameplay mechanics design  

## Tools Used
- C++  
- Visual Studio (or your IDE)  
- GitHub  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Open the project in your C++ IDE (Visual Studio recommended).  
3. Compile and run `main.cpp`.  
4. Follow on-screen instructions to play the game in the console/terminal.  

## Future Enhancements
- Introduce special dice types to provide unique strategic options.  
- Implement a more advanced scoring system for increased complexity.  
- Add optional AI players for single-player mode.
